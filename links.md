List of links with things I don't want to forget or I want to explore in the future (a perfect way of alleviating the large number of tabs opened in my browser).
* [Fast Network Simulation Setup](https://github.com/fnss/fnss): Fast Network Simulation Setup (FNSS) is a toolchain allowing network researchers and engineers to simplify the process of setting up a network experiment scenario. 
* [Fluence Network](https://fluence.network/): Distributed applications without platforms. Fluence is a peer-to-peer computing protocol and a software licensing system. Fluence enables hostless, sovereign applications that are free from proprietary platforms and donâ€™t require infrastructure or even maintenance once published. 
* [Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6347):  The DTLS protocol provides communications privacy for datagram protocols.  The protocol allows client/server applications to communicate in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, or message forgery.
