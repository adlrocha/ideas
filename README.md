# Ideas

[Ideas alone are worthless](https://adlrocha.substack.com/p/adlrocha-ideas-are-worthless), so this repo is an attempt to track and aggregate ideas and reflections I have so that anyone can jump in and discuss them with me. Each idea will be described in an [independent issue](https://github.com/adlrocha/ideas/issues) so anyone is free to enter the discussion or enhance it. 

Additionally, [issues are open for everyone](https://github.com/adlrocha/ideas/issues), so if you want to add your own ideas to the repo so we can discuss it or plan its implementation together, feel free to do so. Of course, this is an experiment that may be abandoned after this initial commit, but let's see how it goes.
